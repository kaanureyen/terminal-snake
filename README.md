# terminal-snake
This is snake - on terminal, possibly 1000th time. I just want to explore the options to draw on terminal, and have fun in the process.

# build
Dependency: `ncurses`

That is a single .c file, needs `ncurses` to be statically linked while compiling.
Please examine `build.sh` for Linux and `build.bat` for Windows.

To build on Windows, MSYS2 is recommended. `mingw-w64-x86_64-ncurses` package can be installed to get `ncurses.h`

# play
Use WASD
